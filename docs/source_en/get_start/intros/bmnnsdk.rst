BMNNSDK is the original deep learning development toolkit of Bitmain.
It is mainly composed of modules such as Quantization & Calibration Tool, BMCompiler, BMDriver, BMLib, BMDecoder, BMCV, BMRuntime.

**Quantization & Calibration Tool**
:It can quantize the model of FP32 precision generated by your training to INT8 precision model,
which is equal to the process of converting fp32_umodel to int8_umodel in the above figure.

**BMCompiler**
:It is a set of model compilation tools that compile your trained deep learning model into a collection of instructions that can be loaded and executed by the Sophon TPU,
and save these instructions in a file with the suffix "bmodel".
The tool supports compiling the FP32 model directly into bmodel.
It also supports compiling the INT8 model generated by Quantization & Calibration Tool to bmodel.

**BMDriver**
:It is the driver for the Sophon TPU and is installed into your operating system kernel in an "insmod" manner.

**BMLib**
:Provides basic interfaces, which can control TPU memory.

**BMDecoder**
:Provides interfaces which used to decode/encode image/video.

**BMCV**
:It can drive TPU for image processing and tensor calculations.

**BMRuntime**
:It provides interfaces to load the "bmodel" file onto the Sophon TPU and drive the TPU chip to implement reasoning.

**SAIL**
:It provides some high level APIs, encapsulated BMRuntime, BMCV and BMDecoder.
